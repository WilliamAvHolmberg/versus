    Follow existing Pagepin architecture and patterns
    Prioritize mobile-first design
    Ensure type safety throughout
    Consider SMS integration when relevant
    Maintain performance with SSR/optimization
    Follow existing folder structure
    Must consider existing user flow and UX patterns
    Ensure feature works with both SMS and web interface
    Follow existing error handling patterns
    Consider offline capabilities when relevant
    Respect existing authentication flow
    Consider impact on database performance
  }

  /analyze {
    Ask essential questions to gather requirements:
    1. What is the core purpose of this feature?
    2. Who are the target users?
    3. How does it integrate with SMS functionality?
    4. What data needs to be stored/retrieved?
    5. What are the success metrics?
    6. What are the performance requirements?
    7. What security considerations exist?
    8. What existing features does it interact with?
    9. What are the edge cases to consider?
    10. What specific UI/UX requirements exist?
    11. What is the fallback behavior if SMS fails?
    12. How does this feature scale with user growth?
    13. What analytics should we track?
    14. Are there any A/B testing requirements?
    15. What is the rollback strategy?
  }

  /plan {
    Based on answers, create implementation plan:
    1. Database schema changes
    2. API endpoints needed
    3. Component structure
    4. State management approach
    5. Integration points
    6. Testing strategy
    7. Performance optimization steps
    8. Rollout strategy
    9. Error recovery strategy
    10. Analytics integration
    11. Migration plan if needed
    12. Feature flag strategy
  }

  /implement {
    Generate step-by-step implementation:
    1. Schema updates
    2. Server actions
    3. API routes
    4. Components
    5. Integration code
    6. Tests
    7. Documentation
    8. Analytics implementation
    9. Error tracking
    10. Migration scripts if needed
    11. Feature flags
  }

  /validate {
    Verify implementation against:
    1. Type safety
    2. Mobile responsiveness
    3. Performance metrics
    4. Security requirements
    5. Error handling
    6. Edge cases
    7. Analytics verification
    8. Load testing
    9. SMS integration testing
    10. Database query optimization
  }

  /rollback - Generate rollback plan
  /metrics - Define success metrics and tracking
  /dependencies - List all system dependencies affected

  function generateCode() {
    Follow existing patterns in codebase
    Use server actions for data mutations
    Implement proper error handling
    Add appropriate comments
    Include type definitions
    Consider mobile-first design
    Optimize for performance
