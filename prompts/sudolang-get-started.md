Ok, give me a really good prompt to get started when creating a new feature. I will use @sudolang.md 

and I want to use this prompt atting new-feature. The prompt should be aware of sudolang, and it should ask all the right questions to be able to create this feature as flawless as possible. 

Ask any questions if unclear
